# Fathur's-Chat

This is my second project. In this project i make whatsapp clone for my self i name it [Fathur's Chat](https://fathur-chat.vercel.com).

## The Technology and Framework That I Use

1. Next.js(Frontend) [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

2. Firebase(backend) [firebase](https://firebase.google.com), I decided to not use Node.js because it's not secure as default so im just using the firebase to more securing my app.

## Getting Started

First, clone my project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadFathurNurRizky/fathurchat
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
